## Written Analysis for WeatherPy

1. The two scatterplots and the linear regression for the max temp vs. latitude support the logic of -- as the location gets closer to the equator (latitude = 0), the temperature goes up. The northern hemisphere has a negative correlation between two factors while the southern hemisphere has a positive coorelation.  

2. There is no correlation between the cloudiness (%) and the latitude.

3. Both scatterplots for humidity and latitude in Northern and Southern hemisphere indicate that there is no strong correlation between the humidity and the latitude. Instead, the scatterplots show that there is more humidity as the temperature arises.
